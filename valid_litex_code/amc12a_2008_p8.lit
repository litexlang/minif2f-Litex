- **split:** `valid`  

### Formal statement
```lean
theorem amc12a_2008_p8
  (x y : ℝ)
  (h₀ : 0 < x ∧ 0 < y)
  (h₁ : y^3 = 1)
  (h₂ : 6 * x^2 = 2 * (6 * y^2)) :
  x^3 = 2 * Real.sqrt 2 := sorry
```

### Informal statement
What is the [[volume]] of a [[cube]] whose [[surface area]] is twice that of a cube with volume 1? 

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \sqrt{2}\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 2\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 2\sqrt{2}\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 4\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 8$ Show that it is \mathrm{(C)}.

### Informal proof
A cube with volume $1$ has a side of length $\sqrt[3]{1}=1$ and thus a surface area of $6 \cdot 1^2=6$. 

A cube whose surface area is $6\cdot2=12$ has a side of length $\sqrt{\frac{12}{6}}=\sqrt{2}$ and a volume of $(\sqrt{2})^3=2\sqrt{2}\Rightarrow\mathrm{(C)}$.


Alternatively, we can use the fact that the surface area of a cube is directly proportional to the square of its side length. Therefore, if the surface area of a cube increases by a factor of $2$, its side length must increase by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$, meaning the new side length of the cube is $1 * \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}$. So, its volume is $({\sqrt{2}})^3 = 2\sqrt{2} \Rightarrow\mathrm{(C)}$.
