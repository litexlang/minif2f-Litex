Problem: amc12a_2009_p5

Informal Statement:
One dimension of a cube is increased by $1$, another is decreased by $1$, and the third is left unchanged. The volume of the new rectangular solid is $5$ less than that of the cube. What was the volume of the cube?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 8 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 27 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 64 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 125 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 216$ Show that it is \text{(D)}.

Formal Statement:
theorem amc12a_2009_p5 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x ^ 3 - (x + 1) * (x - 1) * x = 5) : x ^ 3 = 125 := by

Goal:
x : ℝ
h₀ : x ^ 3 - (x + 1) * (x - 1) * x = 5
⊢ x ^ 3 = 125
