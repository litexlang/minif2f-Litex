Problem: mathd_numbertheory_335

Informal Statement:
When Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. What will the remainder be if she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7? Show that it is 4.

Formal Statement:
theorem mathd_numbertheory_335 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : n % 7 = 5) : 5 * n % 7 = 4 := by

Goal:
n : ℕ
h₀ : n % 7 = 5
⊢ 5 * n % 7 = 4
