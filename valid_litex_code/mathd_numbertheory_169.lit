Problem: mathd_numbertheory_169

Informal Statement:
What is the greatest common factor of $20 !$ and $200,\!000$?  (Reminder: If $n$ is a positive integer, then $n!$ stands for the product $1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot \cdots \cdot (n-1)\cdot n$.) Show that it is 40,\!000.

Formal Statement:
theorem mathd_numbertheory_169 : Nat.gcd 20! 200000 = 40000 := by

Goal:
‚ä¢ 20!.gcd 200000 = 40000

### Formal statement
```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_169 :
  Nat.gcd 20! 200000 = 40000 := sorry
```

### Informal statement
What is the greatest common factor of $20 !$ and $200,\!000$?  (Reminder: If $n$ is a positive integer, then $n!$ stands for the product $1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot \cdots \cdot (n-1)\cdot n$.) Show that it is 40,\!000.

### Informal proof
The prime factorization of $200,000$ is $2^6 \cdot 5^5$. Then count the number of factors of $2$ and $5$ in $20!$. Since there are $10$ even numbers, there are more than $6$ factors of $2$. There are $4$ factors of $5$. So the greatest common factor is $2^6 \cdot 5^4=40,\!000$.
