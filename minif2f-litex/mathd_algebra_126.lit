Problem: mathd_algebra_126

Informal Statement:
The midpoint of the line segment between $(x,y)$ and $(-9,1)$ is $(3,-5)$. Find $(x,y)$. Show that it is (15,-11).

Formal Statement:
theorem mathd_algebra_126 (x y : ℝ) (h₀ : 2 * 3 = x - 9) (h₁ : 2 * -5 = y + 1) : x = 15 ∧ y = -11 := by

Goal:
x y : ℝ
h₀ : 2 * 3 = x - 9
h₁ : 2 * -5 = y + 1
⊢ x = 15 ∧ y = -11
