Problem: mathd_numbertheory_739

Informal Statement:
For each positive integer $n$, let $n!$ denote the product $1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot (n-1)\cdot n$.

What is the remainder when $9!$ is divided by $10$? Show that it is 0.

Formal Statement:
theorem mathd_numbertheory_739 : 9! % 10 = 0 := by

Goal:
‚ä¢ 9! % 10 = 0
